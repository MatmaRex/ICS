InterwikiConflictSolver is a tool to ease the pain of disentangling tangled interwikis on Wikipedias.

Run `ruby interwiki_conflicts.rb` and type in 'help' to get started. (You will need the following gems first: sunflower, launchy, parallel-each.)

You can provide an argument - encoding in which ICS will output strings. Default is cp852 (Windows Central European), you can change it to, for example, utf-8.

.exe files are packaged using Ocra. (Available here: https://github.com/MatmaRex/ICS/downloads)
